Annotations:-
Annotations are used to specify the data type of a variable, parameter, function return value and other types of values. Annotations help developers catch errors early in development by allowing them to specify what types of values can be assigned to a gicen variable or passed as an argument to a function

string👇🏻
//let myVar: type = value

let myName: string = "Anirudh Raturi";
myName = "Another Name";
console.log(myName);

//ERROR 
//myName = 12

number👇🏻
let favNumber: number = 14;
favNumber += 2;
console.log(favNumber);

//ERROR 
//favNumber="Ten";
